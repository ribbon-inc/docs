description: "Connect Ribbon to your Applicant Tracking System"
---

Ribbon integrates with popular Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to streamline your recruiting workflow.

## Supported Systems

Ribbon uses Kombo to connect with a wide range of ATS platforms. Check the integrations page in your Ribbon settings for the full list of supported systems.

## Setting Up an Integration

### Organization-Level Setup

1. Go to **Settings** > **Integrations**
2. Select your ATS from the list
3. Follow the authorization flow to connect your account
4. Once connected, you'll see a confirmation status

### Per-Interview Configuration

After connecting your ATS, configure each interview flow:

1. Open the interview flow settings
2. Go to the **Integrations** tab
3. Select:
   - **ATS Account** - Which connected account to use
   - **Job** - Link to an existing job posting
   - **Stage** - Where to move candidates after interview completion

## How It Works

### Candidate Sync

When a candidate completes a Ribbon interview:

1. Ribbon notifies your ATS
2. The candidate moves to your specified stage
3. Interview data syncs to the candidate's profile

### Job Sync

Ribbon can pull your open jobs from your ATS:

1. Click **Sync Jobs** to refresh the list
2. Select the job to link with your interview flow
3. Stages for that job become available for selection

## Integration Status

Monitor your integration health:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Connected** | Integration is active and working |
| **Syncing** | Currently syncing data |
| **Error** | Connection issue - check settings |

## Troubleshooting

### Jobs Not Appearing
- Click **Sync Jobs** to refresh
- Check that the job is open/active in your ATS
- Verify your ATS permissions allow Ribbon access

### Candidates Not Syncing
- Confirm the interview flow is linked to a job
- Check that a stage is selected
- Verify the candidate's email matches your ATS records

### Connection Lost
- Re-authorize the integration in Settings
- Check your ATS hasn't revoked API access
- Contact support if issues persist

## Best Practices

1. **Link flows to jobs** - Always connect interview flows to ATS jobs for automatic syncing
2. **Choose appropriate stages** - Pick a stage that makes sense in your workflow (e.g., "Phone Screen Complete")
3. **Keep jobs synced** - Refresh your job list when you add new positions
4. **Monitor sync status** - Check the integration status periodically

## What Data Syncs

Ribbon sends to your ATS:
- Interview completion status
- Overall scores (if supported by your ATS)
- Link to view the full interview in Ribbon

<Note>
The specific data that syncs depends on your ATS's capabilities. Some systems support more detailed integration than others.
