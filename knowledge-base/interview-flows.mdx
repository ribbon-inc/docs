An Interview Flow is a reusable template that defines how the AI will conduct interviews for a specific role.

## Creating an Interview Flow

When creating a new flow, you'll configure:

### Basic Information

- **Role Title** - The job title (e.g., "Senior Software Engineer")
- **Organization** - Your company name
- **Location** - Where the role is based
- **Job Description** - Details about the role that help the AI understand context

### Interview Questions

Each flow includes a set of questions for the AI to ask. You can:

- Use the default questions Ribbon provides
- Write your own custom questions
- Reorder questions by dragging and dropping

<Note>
Recruitment interviews default to 5 questions. General interviews default to 3.
</Note>

### Language

Choose from 11 supported languages:
- English (US)
- Chinese (Simplified)
- French
- German
- Hindi
- Japanese
- Portuguese (Brazil)
- Spanish (Latin America)
- Thai
- Arabic (UAE)
- Vietnamese

The AI will conduct the entire interview in your selected language.

## Flow Status

Interview flows have three statuses:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Open** | Actively accepting candidates |
| **Closed** | No longer accepting new candidates |
| **Archived** | Hidden from your main view |

## Managing Candidates

From the flow's Talent Hub, you can:

- View all candidates who have completed interviews
- See candidates who need review
- Track successful interviews
- Manage candidate access within your team

## Sharing Interview Links

Generate interview links to share with candidates:

1. Open your interview flow
2. Click to generate a new interview link
3. Share the link via email, your ATS, or any other channel

Each link is single-use. Once a candidate starts their interview, the link expires.

## Bulk Candidate Import

For high-volume recruiting, import candidates via CSV:

1. Download the CSV template
2. Add candidate emails and names
3. Upload the file to automatically generate and send interview links

## Flow Settings

Each flow has additional settings you can customize:

- **AI Voice & Personality** - Choose who conducts the interview
- **Custom Scoring** - Define what you're looking for
- **Integrations** - Connect to your ATS
- **Webhooks** - Get notified when interviews complete

See the dedicated articles for each of these features.
