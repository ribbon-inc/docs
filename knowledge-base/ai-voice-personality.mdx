## Personality Settings

Beyond voice selection, you can adjust how the AI behaves during interviews.

### Validation Level

Control how the AI responds to candidate answers:

| Setting | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| **Challenging** (1) | Asks follow-up questions, probes deeper |
| **Neutral** (3) | Balanced acknowledgment and follow-up |
| **Validating** (5) | More affirming, encouraging responses |

**When to use:**
- Use **Challenging** for senior roles where you want to test depth
- Use **Validating** for entry-level or high-volume screening
- Use **Neutral** as a balanced default

### Selling Level

Control how much the AI promotes the role:

| Setting | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| **Don't sell** (1) | Focuses only on evaluation questions |
| **Balanced** (3) | Mentions positives when relevant |
| **Actively selling** (5) | Enthusiastically promotes the opportunity |

**When to use:**
- Use **Actively selling** when competing for talent
- Use **Don't sell** for high-volume screening where you want efficiency
- Use **Balanced** for most standard interviews

### Response Speed

Adjust the pause duration between candidate responses and AI follow-up:

- **Slower (2s)** - More natural, conversational pace
- **Faster (0.5s)** - Quicker, more efficient interviews

## Additional AI Instructions

Add custom instructions that apply to all AI interactions:

1. Go to your organization's **Interview Settings**
2. Find **Additional AI Instructions**
3. Add any specific guidance for the AI

Examples:
- "Always ask about remote work preferences"
- "Mention our company values when relevant"
- "Keep responses concise"

These instructions are private and only used for conducting interviews.

## Pronunciation Dictionary

Help the AI correctly pronounce company-specific terms:

1. Go to **Interview Settings**
2. Find **Pronunciation Dictionary**
3. Add words with their phonetic pronunciation

This is especially useful for:
- Company names
- Product names
- Industry-specific terminology
- Names of team members mentioned in interviews

<Note>
The pronunciation dictionary is managed by organization admins and applies to all interviews.

## Custom Introduction & Outro

Personalize what the AI says at the beginning and end of interviews:

### Introduction
The AI's opening message to candidates. Use this to:
- Welcome candidates
- Set expectations for the interview
- Share relevant context about the role

### Outro
The AI's closing message. Use this to:
- Thank candidates for their time
- Explain next steps
- Share any important information

Both can be up to 5,000 characters and can be set at the flow level or use your organization's defaults.

## Preamble Video

Add a video that plays before the interview starts:

1. Open your interview flow settings
2. Find **Preamble Video** (marked as "New")
3. Upload your video
4. Toggle to enable

This is a great way to:
- Introduce your team
- Show your office or culture
- Explain what makes your company special
- Help candidates feel more comfortable
