Ribbon helps recruiting teams conduct AI-powered voice interviews at scale. Instead of manually screening every candidate, Ribbon's AI interviewer conducts natural conversations, scores responses, and surfaces the best candidates for your team to review.

## Key Concepts

### Interview Flows

An **Interview Flow** is a reusable template that defines what the AI interviewer will ask. Each flow includes:

- Role title and job description
- Interview questions (typically 3-5)
- AI voice and personality settings
- Scoring criteria (default and custom)

You create one flow per role, then generate individual interview links for each candidate.

### Interviews

An **Interview** is a single candidate session. When you share an interview link with a candidate, they can complete the interview at their convenience. Each link is single-use - once a candidate starts, that link expires.

### Talent Hub

The **Talent Hub** is where you review completed interviews. For each candidate, you can:

- Watch or listen to the interview recording
- Read the AI-generated transcript and summary
- Review scores and integrity monitoring results
- Cast your hire/no-hire vote
- Compare candidates side-by-side

## Getting Started

1. **Create an Interview Flow** - Define the role, questions, and settings
2. **Share Interview Links** - Send unique links to candidates (individually or in bulk)
3. **Review in Talent Hub** - Watch interviews, review scores, and make decisions
4. **Collaborate with Your Team** - Share access, vote on candidates, and export data

## What Makes Ribbon Different

- **Natural Conversations**: The AI conducts dynamic interviews, not rigid Q&A
- **Customizable AI**: Choose from 8 voices and adjust personality traits
- **Smart Scoring**: Default scores plus unlimited custom scoring criteria
- **Integrity Monitoring**: Detect potential cheating or assistance
