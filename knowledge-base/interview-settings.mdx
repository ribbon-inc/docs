Ribbon offers settings at two levels: organization-wide defaults and per-interview overrides.

## Global Settings

Global settings apply to all interviews by default. Find them in **Settings** > **Interview Settings**.

### Phone Collection

Toggle whether to collect phone numbers from candidates.

- **Enabled**: Candidates must provide a phone number before starting
- **Disabled**: Phone number is optional or not collected

### Consent Screen

Show candidates a consent message before their interview:

- **Enabled**: Candidates see and must accept the consent text
- **Disabled**: Interview starts without a consent step

Default consent text covers recording and sharing with the hiring organization. You can customize this text to match your requirements.

### Pronunciation Dictionary

Add custom pronunciations for words the AI might mispronounce:

- Company names
- Product names
- Technical terminology
- People's names mentioned in interviews

This ensures a professional experience for candidates.

### Additional AI Instructions

Add global instructions that guide AI behavior across all interviews:

```
Examples:
- "Always maintain a professional but warm tone"
- "If candidates ask about salary, say it will be discussed in later rounds"
- "Emphasize our commitment to work-life balance when relevant"
```

## Per-Interview Settings

Override global settings for specific interview flows in the flow's **Settings** tab.

### Introduction & Outro

Customize what the AI says:

- **Introduction**: Opening message to welcome candidates
- **Outro**: Closing message after the interview ends

Both support up to 5,000 characters. Leave blank to use your global defaults.

### Preamble Video

Upload a video that plays before the interview:

- Introduce your team
- Show your office or culture
- Set expectations

Toggle to enable or disable per flow.

### Document Upload

Allow candidates to upload documents:

- **Enable document upload**: Let candidates attach files
- **Resume required**: Make resume upload mandatory

Useful for collecting resumes, portfolios, or other materials.

### Feedback Collection

Let candidates provide feedback on their interview experience:

- **Enabled**: Candidates see a feedback prompt after completing
- **Disabled**: Interview ends without feedback request

### Retry Settings

Control whether candidates can retry their interview:

- **Allow retries**: Candidates can attempt the interview multiple times
- **Disable retries**: One attempt only

If retries are allowed, you can set a maximum number.

### Redirect URL

Send candidates to a specific URL after completing their interview:

- Your careers page
- A "thank you" page
- A next steps page

Leave blank for Ribbon's default completion screen.

### Webhooks

Configure webhooks at the interview level to override organization defaults:

- **Webhook URL**: Where to send event notifications
- **Secret Key**: For verifying webhook signatures

See the [Webhooks documentation](/docs/webhooks) for payload details.

## Settings Priority

Per-interview settings override global settings:

1. Check if interview flow has a custom setting
2. If not, use the global default
3. If no global default, use Ribbon's system default

This lets you set sensible defaults while customizing specific flows as needed.

## Tips

- **Start with globals**: Set up organization defaults first
- **Override sparingly**: Only customize individual flows when needed
- **Document your settings**: Note why specific flows have custom settings
- **Review periodically**: Audit settings as your process evolves
