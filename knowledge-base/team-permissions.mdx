Ribbon's team system lets you organize your recruiting efforts and control who can access what.

## Teams

A team is a group of recruiters who work together on hiring. Each team can have:

- Multiple members with different roles
- Shared interview flows
- Collaborative candidate review

### Creating a Team

1. Go to **Settings** > **Teams**
2. Click **Create Team**
3. Name your team
4. Add members by email

### Team Roles

| Role | Capabilities |
|------|--------------|
| **Admin** | Full control over team settings, members, and all flows |
| **Member** | Access to assigned interview flows based on permissions |

## Interview Flow Permissions

Control access at the interview flow level:

### Permission Types

| Permission | What They Can Do |
|------------|------------------|
| **Can View** | See candidates, watch interviews, view scores |
| **Can Edit** | All view permissions plus: modify flow settings, manage candidates, send invites |

### Setting Permissions

1. Open an interview flow
2. Go to **Settings** > **Access Control**
3. For each team member, toggle:
   - View access (on/off)
   - Edit access (on/off)

### Bulk Permission Actions

Quickly set permissions for everyone:
- **All can view** - Give everyone view access
- **All can edit** - Give everyone edit access
- **Clear all** - Remove all permissions

## Admin-Only Features

Some features are restricted to organization admins:

- **API Keys** - Create and manage API keys
- **Global Interview Settings** - Default settings for all flows
- **Pronunciation Dictionary** - Custom word pronunciations
- **Billing & Payment** - Subscription management
- **Team Management** - Add/remove team members

## Access Requests

If you need access to a flow or candidate outside your team:

1. Find the flow or candidate
2. Click **Request Access**
3. The owner receives a notification
4. They can grant appropriate permissions

This allows cross-team collaboration while maintaining control.

## Best Practices

### For Small Teams
- Use a single team with all members
- Give most people edit access for flexibility

### For Large Organizations
- Create separate teams by department or function
- Use view-only access for stakeholders who need visibility
- Reserve edit access for those actively managing candidates

### For Sensitive Roles
- Limit access to only those directly involved
- Use the request system for ad-hoc needs
- Regularly audit who has access to what
