Ribbon automatically scores every interview on default criteria, but you can also define custom scores tailored to what matters most for your role.

## Default Scores

Every interview is automatically scored on:

- **Communication** - How clearly the candidate expresses themselves
- **Enthusiasm & Motivation** - Their interest in the role and company
- **Skills & Experience** - Relevant background for the position

Each default score is rated out of 5.

## Creating Custom Scores

Custom scores let you evaluate candidates on criteria specific to your role. For example:

- "Leadership Experience"
- "Technical Problem Solving"
- "Customer Empathy"
- "Startup Mentality"

### To create a custom score:

1. Open your interview flow settings
2. Navigate to the **Custom Scoring** section
3. Click **Add Score**
4. Define:
   - **Score Name** - What you're evaluating
   - **Description** - Guidelines for how to score (the AI uses this)
   - **Scoring System** - How to measure it

### Scoring Systems

Choose from three scoring systems:

| System | Description | Best For |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Out of 5** | 1-5 rating scale | Most evaluations |
| **Percentage** | 0-100% scale | Quantifiable skills |
| **Binary** | Yes/No | Must-have requirements |

## Auto-Generate Scores

Not sure what custom scores to create? Ribbon can suggest them:

1. Click **Auto-Generate** in the custom scoring section
2. The AI analyzes your job description and questions
3. Review and edit the suggested scores
4. Add the ones you want to use

## How Scoring Works

After each interview, Ribbon's AI:

1. Reviews the full transcript
2. Evaluates the candidate against each scoring criterion
3. Assigns a score with reasoning
4. Highlights specific quotes that support the score

### Score Details

For each score, you'll see:

- **The Score** - The numerical rating
- **Reason Summary** - Why the AI gave this score
- **Highlights** - Positive and negative moments with timestamps
- **Candidate Quotes** - Exact words from the transcript

Click any highlight to jump to that moment in the interview recording.

## Rescoring Interviews

If you update your scoring criteria, you can rescore all existing interviews:

1. Edit or add custom scores
2. Click **Rescore All Interviews**
3. Ribbon will reprocess all completed interviews with the new criteria

<Warning>
Rescoring can take time for flows with many interviews. You'll see a progress indicator while it runs.
</Warning>

## Tips for Effective Custom Scores

- **Be specific** in your score descriptions - the AI uses them to evaluate
- **Use binary scores** for dealbreakers (e.g., "Has 5+ years experience")
- **Limit to 3-5 custom scores** to keep reviews manageable
- **Update descriptions** if scores aren't capturing what you intended
