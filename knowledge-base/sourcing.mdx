Ribbon's Sourcing feature helps you find qualified candidates using AI-powered search and outreach.

## AI-Powered Candidate Search

The Sourcing chat interface lets you describe who you're looking for in natural language:

- "Find software engineers with React experience in San Francisco"
- "Show me product managers who have worked at startups"
- "Search for sales reps with SaaS experience"

The AI searches across available candidate pools and returns matching profiles.

### Search Progress

When you submit a search, you'll see a real-time progress indicator as the AI:
1. Interprets your requirements
2. Searches candidate databases
3. Ranks and filters results
4. Returns the best matches

### Chat History

Your searches are saved, so you can:
- Return to previous searches
- Refine earlier queries
- Build on past results

## Candidate Outreach

Once you've found candidates, send them interview invitations directly from Ribbon.

### Outreach Workflow

1. **Select Interview** - Choose which interview flow to invite them to
2. **Confirm Candidates** - Review the candidate list and emails
3. **Draft Message** - Write your invitation (or use a template)
4. **Preview & Send** - Review the email before sending

### Customizing Outreach

For each outreach campaign, you can customize:

- **Subject Line** - The email subject candidates will see
- **Message Body** - Your personalized invitation
- **Interview Link** - Automatically included

### Batch Sending

Send invitations to multiple candidates at once:
1. Select all candidates you want to reach
2. Compose a single message
3. Each candidate receives a personalized email with their unique interview link

## Tips for Effective Sourcing

### Writing Good Search Queries

Be specific about what you're looking for:

| Less Effective | More Effective |
|----------------|----------------|
| "engineers" | "backend engineers with Python and AWS experience" |
| "salespeople" | "enterprise sales reps with 5+ years B2B SaaS" |
| "designers" | "product designers who have worked on mobile apps" |

### Outreach Best Practices

- **Personalize when possible** - Reference something specific about the role or company
- **Keep it concise** - Candidates are busy; get to the point
- **Explain the AI interview** - Some candidates may be unfamiliar with the format
- **Set expectations** - Let them know how long the interview takes

## Sourcing Context

You can optionally connect sourcing to:

- **Interview Flow** - Search for candidates who match a specific role
- **Previous Interviews** - Find similar candidates to your best performers

This helps the AI understand exactly what you're looking for.
