Integrity Monitoring helps you identify candidates who may have received external assistance during their interview. Ribbon analyzes multiple signals to flag potential concerns for your review.

## What It Detects

Ribbon monitors four categories of potential integrity concerns:

### Audio Environment

**What it checks:** Clear and unassisted communication

Detects irregular audio patterns that may indicate:
- Another person speaking or whispering
- Text-to-speech tools being used
- Background voices providing answers

### Response Timing

**What it checks:** Irregular response cadence

Analyzes the timing of candidate responses to identify:
- Unnaturally long pauses (possibly reading or typing)
- Responses that are too quick for the question complexity
- Inconsistent pacing throughout the interview

### Input Consistency

**What it checks:** Irregular speaking response patterns

Identifies unnatural speech patterns such as:
- Reading verbatim from a script
- Sudden changes in vocabulary or speaking style
- Responses that don't match natural conversation flow

### Interview Focus

**What it checks:** Dedicated attention to assessment

Detects when a candidate's attention may have wandered:
- Looking away from the screen frequently
- Apparent multitasking during responses
- Signs of distraction or divided attention

## Viewing Integrity Results

After an interview completes, integrity monitoring results appear in the candidate's detail page.

### Status Indicators

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **No concerns detected** (green) | No integrity issues identified |
| **Concern detected** (red) | One or more potential issues flagged |
| **Processing** | Analysis still in progress |

### Reviewing Concerns

When concerns are detected:

1. Click to expand the Integrity Monitoring section
2. See each concern type that was flagged
3. Click **Jump to moment** to see exactly when it occurred
4. Watch that portion of the interview to make your own judgment

Each concern includes:
- The type of concern
- A description of what was detected
- The timestamp where it occurred

## Important Considerations

<Warning>
Integrity monitoring is a tool to assist your review, not a definitive judgment. Always watch flagged moments before making decisions.
</Warning>

### False Positives Can Occur

Some legitimate situations may trigger flags:
- Poor internet connection affecting audio
- Candidate thinking before answering (response timing)
- Non-native speakers with different speech patterns
- Candidates in noisy environments

### Use as One Data Point

Integrity monitoring should be one factor in your evaluation, alongside:
- Interview scores
- Specific answers and examples given
- Your overall impression from watching the interview

## Best Practices

1. **Review flagged moments directly** - Don't rely solely on the flag
2. **Consider context** - Technical issues can cause false positives
3. **Look for patterns** - Multiple flags across categories are more significant
4. **Trust your judgment** - You make the final call on candidate integrity
