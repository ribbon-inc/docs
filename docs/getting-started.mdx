# 🧠 What is Ribbon API?

Ribbon API lets you create intelligent AI-powered voice interviews. To interview someone, all you have to do is share a link.

Ribbon's AI interviewer can hold a natural and intelligent conversation with your interviewee. You can use the Ribbon API to create many types of interviews including: product interviews, surveys, recruitment interviews, health questionnaires, and much more. Use your imagination!

# 📖 Concepts

Ribbon API has two concepts: **Interview Flows** and **Interviews**

**Interview Flows** are reusable sets of questions and context. They have two types: `general` (default) and `recruitment`.

**Interviews** are created from **Interviews Flows**. Each interview has a one use session link. To interview someone, all you have to do is share the link! Once the interviewee has visited the interview link, the link is expired.

# 💬 Interview type: General vs. Recruitment

When creating an interview flow, you can choose between two interview types: `general` and `recruitment`.

## `general` type interviews

All interviews are `general` type by default. This is a more generic type of interview suitable for multiple use cases.

## `recruitment` type interviews

If you are screening a potential job candidate, you should use `recruitment` type interviews. These interviews are also displayed within the Ribbon platform giving you the opportunity to use Ribbon to view, score, and share the candidates more easily.
